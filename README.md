## 📚 Study Tips

1. **Master one pattern at a time**
   Don't jump between patterns. Complete 80% of problems in one pattern before moving on.

2. **Easy → Medium → Hard**
   Always solve easier problems first to build understanding.

3. **Understand, don't memorize**
   Focus on WHY the pattern works, not just the code.

4. **Document your learnings**
   Create solution files in `algorithms/pattern-name/problems/` folder.

5. **Review regularly**
   Revisit completed problems: after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.

6. **Time yourself**
   - Easy: 15-20 min
   - Medium: 25-35 min
   - Hard: 40-50 min
